# Contributing

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct. Contributions will be fully **credited**.

Contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/zembrowski/phpsms-poland) are accepted.


## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP-CS-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) or [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider the release cycle** - Versioning nomenclature of [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/) is being applied.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```


**Happy coding**!
